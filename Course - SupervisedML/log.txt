29/11/22 : Hey, I am beginning the 1st Course of Andrew Ng from DeepLearning.Ai. I will store all the codes on a remote repository
owned by me. It will be a public repository and this is the first file that I will push to that repo.

2/12/22 : I have completed week 2. Successfully implemented univariate and multiple linear regression using train and test data from random
online sources. I came across an idea called backward elimination that I will look into and using that, along with feature scaling,
I will probably re-implement my multiple linear regression model to train it better.
Also, a useful feature that I was previously unaware of that would be handy in multiple linear regression is subplots in matplotlib
to plot graphs of multiple features with the target.

3/12/22 : Completed Course 1: Supervised Learning - Regression and Classification
I came across some useful NumPy functions, some of which I have already used in my codes, 
like np.dot(), np.mean(), np.exp(), np.zeros_like(), np.cos(), np.arange(), np.c_(), np.ptp()
